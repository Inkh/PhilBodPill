### Product Care
---

Machine wash on delicate/gentle settings with **cold** water only. 

Place pillow in dryer on low heat settings. After 30 minutes, fluff and flip. Do **not** remove pillow from dryer until it is 100% dry. Mold may form if product is taken out of cycle prematurely. It will not be pleasant. Usage of a few tennis/dryer balls during drying cycle is recommended to restore loft. Be prepared for the entire process to take up to 4-5 hours.

**IMPORTANT**: NOT dishwasher safe.
